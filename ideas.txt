​[11:45] manhkwong (Guest)
tracking task success for meeting deadlines
​[11:45] kimdam92 (Guest)
idk we are able to do but can we expand tamagochi more
​[11:46] kimdam92 (Guest)
timer and to do list are hard to improve unless adding new content
​[11:46] manhkwong (Guest)
to do list can sort into catorgories
​[11:46] manhkwong (Guest)
timer alarm is pet's cry
​[11:46] kimdam92 (Guest)
like quest logs in MMORPG
​[11:47] manhkwong (Guest)
yes?
​[11:47] kimdam92 (Guest)
im thinking of making app interface like actual game
​[11:47] manhkwong (Guest)
buy different ring tones/pet cry
[11:48] manhkwong (Guest)
blocks interaction with pet if failing to meet targets or if you have a lot of tasks to do
​[11:50] manhkwong (Guest)

​[12:14] kimdam92 (Guest)
about us page
​[12:14] Pinal Shah
yes good...
​[12:15] Pinal Shah
The best idea is....visit three or four IT company website...Because in company website the content is more important...
​[12:15] Pinal Shah
Company Profile...No of projects the company has...Team members of that project...Any funding received from Government for any project
​[12:16] Pinal Shah
so these are the general ideas you can look for while working on your website...
​[12:17] Pinal Shah
Important thing: CEO Message on home page, events, seminar, workshops...there are so many things...you just come up with your own creative content and discuss with me and Manju...
